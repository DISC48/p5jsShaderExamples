# p5.js Shader Examples  

A collection of heavily commented 2d shaders in p5.js. I tried to write shaders that might be useful for those learning GLSL and wanting to get into the basics of 2d image manipulation. For now these are only 2d / texture shaders.

## Basics  

These shaders are about as stripped down as can be. They mostly just render colors to the screen. Start here if you've never seen or used a shader before.
